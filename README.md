Thanks for stopping by! I will continue to add to this, but for now here are a few things I have going on:

- 🚀 I’m currently working on [Jetboost](https://jetboost.io), [CodeCrumbs](https://codecrumbs.co) and [Rubicons](https://userubicons.com)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and bettering my JS skills
- 👬 I’m looking to meet new people and learn more
- 💬 How to reach me: [@noahraskin_](https://twitter.com/noahraskin_)
- 🎹 Fun fact: I make music too, so if you want to collab on something, let me know.
